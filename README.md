Arduino code used to run the Garden of d'Lights at the Ruth Bancroft Garden.

## The Ruth Bancroft Garden

In December 2018 I was asked if I would like to put together a light show to light uup the plants at
[The Ruth Bancroft Garden](https://www.ruthbancroftgarden.org/) in Walnut Creek, California. A garden named
*The most beautiful garden in the world* by [Tripadvisor](https://www.travelandleisure.com/ruth-bancroft-garden-walnut-creek-california-named-most-beautiful-in-world-tripadvisor-data-study-8700410).

I spent the next year researching LED and laser lighting to create some unique lighting installations for the garden.
Some of the installations used NeoPixel LED strips and many people have asked me how I created these lights, so
I am documenting these installations here.
